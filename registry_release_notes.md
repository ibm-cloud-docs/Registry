## 15 September 2022
{: #registry-15sep2022}
{: release-note}

{{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} plug-in 1.0.0 is available {: #15sep2022_v1}
:   A new version, version 1.0.0, of the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} CLI plug-in is available. To update the version of your {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} CLI plug-in, see [Install the `container-registry` CLI plug-in](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-devtools-manually#idt-install-container-registry-cli-plugin).

   Version 1.0.0 includes [Vulnerability Advisor 4](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_release_notes#15sep2022_va_version_4).
   
   In version 1.0.0, the `ibmcloud cr image-list` and `ibmcloud cr image-digests` commands no longer include security status by default. To include security status, you can either add the `--va` option to the command, or use the [`ibmcloud cr va`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli#bx_cr_va) command to query the security status for an individual image.
   
   For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} CLI stops returning security status results in lists by default from version 1.0.0](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_lists).

All releases of {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} plug-in 0.1 are deprecated {: #15sep2022_v0}
:   All releases of version 0.1 of the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} CLI plug-in are deprecated. You can continue to use releases of version 0.1, but version 1.0.0 is available for you to use. To update the version of your CLI plug-in, see [Install the `container-registry` CLI plug-in](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-devtools-manually#idt-install-container-registry-cli-plugin).

Vulnerability Advisor 4 is available from {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} plug-in 1.0.0 {: #15sep2022_va_version_4}
:   From {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} plug-in 1.0.0, you can choose whether to use Vulnerability Advisor version 3 or version 4 to run your commands. Vulnerability Advisor 4 is available from version 1.0.0 of the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} plug-in. Vulnerability Advisor 3 is the default.

    If you want to continue to use version 3, you don't need to do anything. 
    
    If you want to use version 4 to run the `ibmcloud cr va`, `ibmcloud cr image-list`, or `ibmcloud cr image-digests` commands, see [Setting the Vulnerability Advisor version](/docs/Registry?topic=va-va_index&interface=ui#va_set_version).

    For more information about Vulnerability Advisor, see [About Vulnerability Advisor](/docs/Registry?topic=va-va_index&interface=ui#about). For more information about Vulnerability Advisor API 4, see [Vulnerability Advisor 4 for {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/container-registry/va-v4).</staging><staging>

New commands for setting and checking the Vulnerability Advisor version are available from {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} plug-in 1.0.0 {: #15sep2022_va_version_commands}
:   From {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} plug-in 1.0.0, you can use new commands to check and set Vulnerability Advisor versions.

    If you want to continue to use version 3, you don't need to do anything.

    If you want to use version 4, you can set the version by running the [`ibmcloud cr va-version-set`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli#ic_cr_va_version_set) command.
    
    For more information about setting the version by using the `ibmcloud cr va-version-set` command, see [`ibmcloud cr va-version-set`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli#ic_cr_va_version_set) and [Setting the Vulnerability Advisor version](/docs/Registry?topic=va-va_index&interface=ui#va_set_version).

    To find out which version of Vulnerability Advisor you're running, see [`ibmcloud cr va-version`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli#ic_cr_va_version).

## 3 August 2022
{: #registry-03aug2022}
{: release-note}

The CLI stops returning security status results in lists by default from version 1.0.0 {: #03aug2022_list}
:   From {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} CLI plug-in version 1.0.0, when you use the [`ibmcloud cr image-list`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli&interface=ui#bx_cr_image_list) and [`ibmcloud cr image-digests`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli&interface=ui#bx_cr_image_digests) commands to list images, they return Vulnerability Advisor security status results only if you use the `--va` option.

    If you want to continue to receive security status with your lists, prepare to upgrade by adding the new `--va` option to your commands.

    For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} CLI stops returning security status results in lists by default from version 1.0.0](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_lists).

{: #registry-05jul2022}
{: release-note}

Change to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} private IP addresses in all regions {: #05jul2022_private_network}

    - `eu-central (de.icr.io)`
    - `ap-south (au.icr.io)`

The {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} private IP addressees have also changed. This change also affects you if you have allowlists or a firewall rule. Other regions are not affected yet.

    For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} private IP addresses changed on 5 July 2022](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_iam_private_network) and [Using IAM IP address access restrictions](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_iam_ip).

{: release-note}

You can set permissions so that access to resources within a namespace can be configured at the resource group level {: #29jul2020_resource_group}

    - Namespaces created in version 0.1.485 of the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}} CLI or later, or in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console on or after 29 July 2020, are created in a resource group that you specify so that you can configure access to resources within the namespace at the [resource group](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs) level. However, you can still set permissions for the namespace at the account level or in the namespace itself. For more information, see [Set up a namespace](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-started#gs_registry_namespace_add) and [`ibmcloud cr namespace-add`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli#bx_cr_namespace_add).

You can assign an existing namespace to a resource group so that you can configure access to resources within a namespace at the resource group level. For more information, see [Assigning existing namespaces to resource groups](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_setup_cli_namespace#registry_namespace_assign) and [`ibmcloud cr namespace-assign`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli#ic_cr_namespace_assign).

    - You can find out which namespaces are assigned to resource groups and which are unassigned by running the [`ibmcloud cr namespace-list`](/docs/Registry?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli#bx_cr_namespace_list) command with the `-v` option.

Therefore, if you want more control over access to your {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} resources, you can add IAM access policies. For example, you can change the API key policies in the cluster's pull secret so that images are pulled from a certain registry region or namespace only.

    For more information, see [Understanding how to authorize your cluster to pull images from a registry](/docs/containers?topic=containers-registry#cluster_registry_auth).

New region in ap-north {: #25feb2019_ap-north}
