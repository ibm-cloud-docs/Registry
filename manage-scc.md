## Governing {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} resource configuration
{: #govern-container-registry}

As a security or compliance focal, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} dashboard to define [configuration rules](#x3084914){: term} for {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}.

Configuration rules are used to enforce the configuration standards that you want to implement across your accounts. To learn more about the data that you can use to create a rule for {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, review the following table.

You can restrict your rule to a specific registry instance by specifying either the `registry` or `region` target attributes. For example, to restrict your rule to the registry instance in `us-south`, you can use the `string_equals` *operator* to require that either the *target attribute* `registry` matches the *value* `us.icr.io`, or the *target attribute* `region` matches the *value* `us-south`.

| Resource kind | Property | Operator | Value | Description |
|---------------|----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| *Service* | *iam_authz* | *is_true*  \n *is_false* | Not applicable | Enables role-based authorization for authenticating with {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}}. |
| *Service* | *private_only* | *is_true*  \n *is_false* | Not applicable | Restricts the account so that it can push and pull images by using private connections only. |
| *Service* | *platform_metrics* | *is_true*  \n *is_false* | Not applicable | Publishes {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} platform metrics. |
{: caption="Table 1. Rule properties for {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}" caption-side="bottom"}

For example, use the following rule if you want *private_only* to be true, but only in the `us-south` registry.

```txt
{
    "target": {
        "service_name": "container-registry",
        "resource_kind": "service",
        "additional_target_attributes": [
            {
                "name": "registry",
                "operator": "string_equals",
                "value": "us.icr.io"
            }
        ]
    },
    "required_config": {
        "description": "IBM Cloud Container Registry account-level regional settings",
        "and": [
            {
                "property": "private_only",
                "operator": "is_true"
            }
        ]
    }
}
