# Managing user access for {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}}
{: #iam}

Access to {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}} for users in your account is controlled by {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM).
{: shortdesc}

From 5 July 2022, all accounts will require IAM access policies. If you started to use {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} before the availability of [IAM API key policies in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_release_notes#registry-25feb2019) in February 2019, you must now ensure that you are using IAM access policies to manage access to the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} service. For more information, see [IAM access policies are required from 5 July 2022](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_iam_policy) and [Defining IAM access policies](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-user).
{: important}

When IAM access policies are enabled for your account in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}, every user that accesses the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} service in your account must be assigned an IAM [access policy](x2853407){: term} with an IAM user role defined. That policy determines what role the user has within the context of the service, and what actions the user can perform. Each action in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} is mapped to one or more [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM roles](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles) user roles.

IAM access policies are enforced only when you use IAM to log in to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}. If you want to restrict user access to one or more [namespaces](x2031005){: term} for an ID that you are using for automation, use an IAM service ID. For more information about service IDs, see [Creating and working with service IDs](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids#serviceids).

From version 0.1.485 of the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}} CLI or later, or in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console on or after 29 July 2020, you can set permissions so that you can configure access to resources within a namespace at the [resource group](x2161955){: term} level. For more information, see [User permissions for working with namespaces](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_setup_cli_namespace#registry_setup_cli_namespace_plan_perm).

If you started to use {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} before 4 October 2018, you must enable policy enforcement for each region so that you can use IAM access policies to manage access to the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} service. If you do not enable this policy, any user in the account can manage registry resources. For more information, see [Enabling policy enforcement for existing users](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-user#existing_users).
{: tip}

From 19 August 2021, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} tokens are discontinued and do not work. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} Deprecates Registry Tokens for Authentication](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-cloud-container-registry-deprecates-registry-tokens-for-authentication){: external}.

For more information about IAM, see [What is {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}}?](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview#iamoverview)

For more information about enabling policies for {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}, see [Defining IAM access policies](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-user#user).

Policies enable access to be granted at different levels. Some options include the following access levels:

- Access to the service in your account
- Access to a specific resource within the service
- Access to all IAM-enabled services in your account
- Access to resources within a [resource group](x2161955){: term}

After you define the scope of the IAM access policy, you assign a role. Review the following tables that outline what actions each role allows within the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} service.

For more information about assigning user roles in the UI, see [Managing access to resources](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources).

## Platform management roles
{: #platform_management_roles}

The following table details actions that are mapped to platform management roles. Platform management roles enable users to perform tasks on service resources at the platform level, for example assign user access for the service, and create or delete service IDs.

| Platform management roles | Description of actions | Example actions |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Viewer | Not supported | |
| Editor | Not supported | |
| Operator | Not supported | |
| Administrator | Configure access for other users.  \n  \n Apply pull secrets to clusters. | For more information about assigning user roles in the UI, see [Managing access to resources](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources).  \n  \n To create clusters in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} that have pull secrets to access images in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}, you must have the Administrator role. To use the [`ibmcloud ks cluster pull-secret apply`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_pull_secret_apply) command to configure pull secrets for an existing cluster, you must have the Administrator role. For more information, see [Preparing to create clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#cluster_prepare). |

## Service access roles
{: #service_access_roles}

From 5 July 2022, all accounts will require IAM access policies. If you started to use {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} before the availability of [IAM API key policies in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_release_notes#registry-25feb2019) in February 2019, you must now ensure that you are using IAM access policies to manage access to the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} service. For more information, see [IAM access policies are required from 5 July 2022](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_iam_policy) and [Defining IAM access policies](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-user).
{: important}

The following table details actions that are mapped to service access roles. Service access roles give users access to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} as well as the ability to call the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} API.

| Service access role | Description of actions | Example actions|
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Reader | The Reader role can view information. | View, inspect, and pull images.  \n  \n View and analyze namespaces.  \n  \n View quotas.  \n  \n View vulnerability reports.  \n  \n View image signatures.  \n  \n View retention policies.  \n  \n View the contents of the trash.  \n  \n View the contents of the manifest for an image.  \n  \n List Vulnerability Advisor security exemption policies and types of security exemptions. |
| Writer | The Writer role can edit information. | Push, delete, and restore images.  \n  \n View quotas.  \n  \n Sign images.  \n  \n Set and run retention policies.  \n  \n Delete all untagged images in your {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} account. |
| Manager | The Manager role can perform all actions. | View, inspect, pull, push, delete, and restore images.  \n  \n View, add, analyze, and remove namespaces.  \n  \n Assign namespaces to resource groups.  \n  \n View and set quotas.  \n  \n View vulnerability reports.  \n  \n View and create image signatures.  \n  \n Review and change pricing plans.  \n  \n Enable IAM access policy enforcement.  \n  \n List, add, and remove Vulnerability Advisor security issue exemption policies.  \n  \n List types of security exemptions.  \n  \n Set and run retention policies.  \n  \n View the contents of the trash.  \n  \n Restore images.  \n  \n  View the contents of the manifest for an image.  \n  \n Prevent or allow image pulls or pushes over public network connections for your account.  \n  \n Check whether the use of public connections is prevented for image pushes or pulls in your account.  \n  \n Delete all untagged images in your {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} account. |
{: caption="Table 2. IAM service access roles and actions" caption-side="bottom"}

For the following {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} commands, you must have at least one of the specified roles as shown in the following tables. To create a policy that allows access to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}, you must create a policy where the following criteria apply.

- The service name is `container-registry`.
- The service instance is empty.
- The region is the region that you want to grant access to, or is empty to give access to all regions.

### Access roles for configuring {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}
{: #access_roles_configure}

To grant a user permission to configure {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} in your account, you must create a policy that grants one or more of the roles in the following table. When you create your policy, you must not specify a `resource type` or `resource`. Policies for configuring {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} must not be set at a resource group level.

For example, run the following `ibmcloud iam user-policy-create` command. Where `<user_email>` is the user's email address, `<region>` is the region, and `<roles>` is the role, or roles, that you want the user to have.

```txt
ibmcloud iam user-policy-create <user_email> --service-name container-registry --region <region> --roles <roles>
```

### Access roles for using {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}
{: #access_roles_using}

To grant a user permission to access {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} content in your account, you must create a policy that grants one or more of the roles in the following table. When you create your policy, you can restrict access to a specific namespace by specifying the resource type `namespace` and the namespace name as the resource. If you don't specify a `resource-type` and a `resource`, the policy grants access to all resources in the account. Alternatively, if your namespace is within a resource group, permission can be granted by using an IAM access policy on that resource group.

For example, use the following command to create a user policy. Where `<user_email>` is the user's email address, `<region>` is the region, `<roles>` is the role, or roles, that you want the user to have, and `<namespace_name>` is the name of the namespace.

```txt
ibmcloud iam user-policy-create <user_email> --service-name container-registry --region <region> --roles <roles> [--resource-type namespace --resource <namespace_name>]
```
